# Fiscus Flashcards

## What
This repo holds a program that allows a user (you?) to be presented with and answer a set of 30 questions - the flashcards - related to JavaScript array prototype methods and related concepts. While playing the program will show a question and answers in a multiple choice format. After selecting an answer the program will say whether that answer was correct or incorrect. After all 30 flashcards have been displayed and answered, the program will signify that the game has ended and will also give a calculation of how many questions were answered correctly.
